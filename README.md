2D Driving Game
## Description

Drive at high speed through traffic and survive the dangers you'll encounter. Will you make it through the night?

You control a car in order to dodge incoming cars through 8 completely different levels. Each level has its own new type of vehicles or obstacles. A new ability is unlocked after a couple of levels ( won't spoil it for you ).

There is a surprise for you at the end of the game.

## Development

The game was developed in LUA for [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php), a fantasy console that exists only in software but has almost the same limitations as the retro consoles back in the ~80s. Due to these limitations I was able to squeeze only 8 levels in the game. The cartridge of the game with all the game code, sounds and graphics can fit in a very small .PNG image.

Pico 8 does not have built-in particle effects, sprite rotation functionality or physics / collision detection. So I had to build my own methods, from scratch. Although the levels might seem procedurally generated only the visual aspect of the traffic is randomly changed each time you play.
